 - All items have a sell_in attributes which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
 - All items have a quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
 - At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item by calling update_quality


 - Once the sell by date has passed, quality degrades twice as fast
 - The quality of an item is never negative
 - "Aged Brie" actually increases in quality the older it gets
 - The quality of an item is never more than 50
 - "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
 - "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its sell_in value approaches;
 quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
 quality drops to 0 after the concert
